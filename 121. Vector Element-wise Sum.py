121. Vector Element-wise sum [Easy] 

Write a Python function that computes the element-wise sum of two vectors.
The function should return a new vector representing the resulting sum if the operation is valid, or -1 if the vectors have incompatible dimensions.
Two vectors (lists) can be summed element-wise only if they are of the same length.

Example:
Input:
a = [1, 3], b = [4, 5]
Output:
[5, 8]
Reasoning:
Element-wise sum: [1+4, 3+5] = [5, 8].

Insights: 

-None, a basic question that can be done by anyone

#SOLUTION: 

import numpy as np 

def vector_sum(a: list[int|float], b: list[int|float]) -> list[int|float]:
	# Return the element-wise sum of vectors 'a' and 'b'.
	# If vectors have different lengths, return -1.
    A = np.array(a, dtype=float)
    B = np.array(b, dtype=float)
  
    if len(a) != len(b):
        return -1 

    return (A+B)
