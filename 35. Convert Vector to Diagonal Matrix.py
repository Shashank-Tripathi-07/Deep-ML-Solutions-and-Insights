35. Convert Vector to Diagonal Matrix [Easy] [Linear Algebra] 

Write a Python function to convert a 1D numpy array into a diagonal matrix. The function should take in a 1D numpy array x and return a 2D numpy array representing the diagonal matrix.

Example:
Input:
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    output = make_diagonal(x)
    print(output)
Output:
[[1. 0. 0.]
    [0. 2. 0.]
    [0. 0. 3.]]
    
Reasoning:
The input vector [1, 2, 3] is converted into a diagonal matrix where the elements of the vector form the diagonal of the matrix.

Insights: 
-none, just two numpy calculations 

Solutions: 

"""

import numpy as np

def make_diagonal(x):
	# Your code here
	y = np.array(x, dtype=float)
    
    return np.diag(y)
